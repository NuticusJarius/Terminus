Find three numbers to input into this machine, the numbers will be different every match. Have all members of the team interact with the valves on the tank. Doing so will begin a miniboss lockdown, kill the miniboss.

#### Number locations:
In the interrogation rooms, the hour hand of this clock:\

\
Keep interacting with it. Bring the whole team under the shipwreck, and climb up the ladder. Grab a couple of the pipes on the bench in that room. This will begin a lockdown. Once done check three locations to insert these pipes.

#### Pipe insertion locations:
On the south island, by the coast.\

### Step 6:
Interact with Peck until he gives you a hacking device. Pick it up and have a teammate drive the hacker around the water to three buoys. When close, hack the bouy (the hacker can float in the water while hacking, and the driver can take the heat off of the hacker). When the first buoy is hacked, a timer will start. Once all buoys are hacked a new timer will start. Everyone needs to go into the biolab to find and disarm three bombs in the labs to end the timer.\

It takes about 15 seconds to disarm each bomb.

### Step 7:
Prepare for a boss fight, and get one weapon with some range to max rarity and max tier. It will take too many rounds to max out another gun. Try to bring in a chopper gunner as well. Make sure you get most of the perks.

### Step 8:
Enter the boss fight by initiating a vote on an ajar door in the biolab. The boss takes most of its damage while hitting its glowing weak points. The glowing spots will change frequently. It has a main slam attack in front of it that will kill without armor. The boss relocates based on where players are. In the last phase, the weak points will be the eyes. The sides of the arena are closed off and it will no longer move around. The boss now employs a tongue attack in front of it that will kill you if you touch it. The boss will start to use a wipe attack when it conjures an electric ball above its head. Get out of line of sight when that happens. Use the chopper gunner during the last phase because he does not relocate during it.

### Step 9:
gg bye bye
