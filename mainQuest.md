Keep interacting with it. Bring the whole team under the shipwreck, and climb up the ladder. Grab a couple of the pipes on the bench in that room. This will begin a lockdown. Once done check three locations to insert these pipes.

### Step 6:
Interact with peck until he gives you a hacking device. Pick it up and have a teammate drive the hacker around the water to three buoys. When close, hack the bouy (hacker can float in the water while hacking, driver can take the heat off of the hacker). When the first buoy is hacked, a timer will start. Once all buoys are hacked a new timer will start. Everyone needs to go into the biolab to find and disarm three bombs in the labs to end the timer.\

It takes about 15 seconds to disarm each bomb.

### Step 7:
Prepare for bossfight, get one weapon with some range to max rarity and max tier. It will take too many rounds to max out another gun. Try to bring in a chopper gunner as well. Make sure you got most perks.

### Step 8:
Enter the bossfight by initiating a vote on an ajar door in the biolab. The boss takes most of its damage while hitting its glowing weakpoints. The glowing spots will change frequently. It has a main slam attack in front of it that will kill without armor. The boss relocates based on where players are. The last phase, the weakpoints will be the eyes. Te sides of the arena are closed off and it will no longer move around The boss now employs a tounge attack in front of it that will kill you if you touch it. The boss will start to use a wipe attack when it conjures a electric ball above its head. Get out of line of sight when that happens. Use the chopper gunner during the last phase because he does not relocate during it.

### Step 9:
gg bye bye
